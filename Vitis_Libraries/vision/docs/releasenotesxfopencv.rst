.. _pl-new:

New features and functions
============================

**PL additions/enhancements**:
    • New functions:
		- Rotate
		- TV-L1 optical flow
		- Multi-stream ISP (basic) support
    • Updates:
		- Added Demosaicing kernel (xf_demosaicing_rt.hpp) having the input Bayer pattern as run time parameter
		- Fixed issue with RGBIR L1 testbench
		- Added support for custom depth specification for xf::cv::Mat in all kernels                       
    • Lib Infra Changes:
		- Added API JSON for L2, that helps in usage of a given function's API in Vitis GUI	

**AIE additions/enhancements:**
    • Updates:
		- Introduced RTL Data-movers with improved latency over HLS data-movers
		- All tests updated with RTL data-movers

.. _known-issues:

Known issues
==============
**`** 
    • Vitis GUI projects on RHEL83 and CEntOS82 may fail because of a lib conflict in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting. User needs to remove ${env_var:LD_LIBRARY_PATH} from the project environment settings for the function to build successfully.
    • SVM L2 PL function fails hardware emulation with 2022.1 Vitis. Please use 2021.1 Vitis for this function.
    • rgbir2bayer, isppipeline_rgbir PL functions are not supplied with input images
    • Software emulation for Warptransform L2 testcases doesn't work because of a known issue with platform.
    • Warptransform L1 URAM cases fail CSim because of a known HLS issue.    
    • Hardware emulation in AIE testcases may throw segmentation fault at the end, although completing the functional test successfully.
